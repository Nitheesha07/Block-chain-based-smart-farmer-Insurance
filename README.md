The basic idea is to make insurance system smart and automated by using
blockchain technology to decrease the settlement duration for the farmers
and reducing the manual risk analysis effort by insurance company with
the help of artificial intelligence. With the help of smart risk analysis
system it can be identified in real time whether a drought or any other
calamities has hit the grounds and if it does then blockchain smart
contract will be executed and funds will be transferred to farmers in
real time from the insurance company.
